## Projects and Skills

In this section, I hope to show you how much knowledge and experience I have. I don't intend to be arrogant or boastful, but simply to present my capabilities, which I hope will be useful to you.
I implement this projects based on my daily work. I can't show data from where I stay. So, I show you some of my skills through this "projects".

- [Project 2](/projects/two)(soon)
- [Project 3](/projects/three)(a lot of soon)

## Courses

I have two courses published, where I teach about Virtualization and a little introduction about Firewalls. Both courses was implemented over open source platforms. I show how to use Virtualization in three scenarios(standalone servers, dual servers environments and hyper-convergence) with Proxmox Virtualization Platform, and how to use OPNSense to build firewalls to protect the network to beginners.

- [ Proxmox VE 8.x](https://www.udemy.com/course/proxmox-ve-8x/)

If you're interested in learning about virtualization, you've come to the right place. If you'd also like to learn about Proxmox, you're in the right place.

In this course, we'll learn about virtualization using a high-level open source tool, Proxmox VE version 8.x (PVE), focusing on implementing hyper-converged environments!
The course is designed to develop activities sequentially, where actions performed in one class have an impact on subsequent classes. This is how the course context is set up and presented.

Ps.: The course is in Brazilian Portuguese

- [Guide of OPNSense Firewall](https://www.udemy.com/course/guia-opnsense/)

I'd like to welcome you in advance to our Basic Guide to the OPNSENSE Firewall, where we'll explore this tool and develop skills for your professional or personal development.

In this course, we'll learn about the OPNSENSE Firewall and explore some everyday contexts of firewall services in the network. This will help you get the most out of using an open source firewall by applying basic information security rules and aligning it with business needs.

Believe me, starting with the basics will put you ahead of the curve.

Ps.: The course is in Brazilian Portuguese

## Other Projects

Here I present my older past experiences. Maybe you find interesting know how I faced some challenges, how the solution was developed and results I achieved.
I have selected some challenges that I believe deserve to be remembered. And, no, I don't have registers of all that. In some cases, I can't have them, cause of ethical or contract terms.
Let's go from the most recent experiences to the oldest.

### (Current)CADE - Conselho Administrativo de Defesa Econôminica(Administrative Council for Economic Defense)

The highest body in the area of competition defense in Brazil. I wanted to work here because I wanted to do something that would really impact the organization's results.
After my previous experience, I certain will contribute more here.

### UFSB - Universidade Federal do Sul da Bahia(Federal University of Southern Bahia)

I started here with the first team approved in a public service exam. When we started (as we speak here), there was only weeds and empty rooms.
I actively participated in the planning, design and execution of the entire structuring of IT services in the area of networks and infrastructure, distributed over three cities.
From 2019 to 2022 I was Director of IT Architecture and Security, where I was responsible for a team of 5 people who maintained the entire Network Structure, Firewalls, and services such as Private Cloud, Authentication (Active Directory), Virtualization, Backup, Wireless Networks, Configuration Management and others.

#### SBPC(Brazilian Society for the Advancement of Science) 2016

This was an event organized by the SBPC (Brazilian Society for the Advancement of Science), held in 2016. The event had an estimated attendance of 10,000 people over the course of a week, with approximately 4,000 visitors per day.
I was responsible for the design and implementation of the entire network structure. In this case, it was necessary to modify the existing network structure, which we can call Network V1.
The resources implemented for the event included a redundant network firewall, dedicated active monitoring, and wired and wireless network integration to serve the event's diverse audiences.
The structure was considered one of the most stable in the event's history.

### SCMI - Santa Casa de Misericórdia de Itabuna(Holy House of Mercy of Itabuna)

When I started here, we experienced a significant growth boom. We went from 100 to 500 desktops, a lot of new services, ERP changing and going from two to three sites (three hospitals in the managed network).
I learned a lot and I am very grateful for all the experience I gained in this critical environment, where lives are at stake.
