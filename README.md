## Courses

I have two courses published, where I teach about Virtualization and a little introduction about Firewalls. Both courses was implemented over open source platforms. I show how to use Virtualization in three scenarios wit Proxmox Virtualization Plattform, and how to use OPNSense to build firewalls to protect the network to beginners.

- [ Proxmox VE 8.x](https://www.udemy.com/course/proxmox-ve-8x/)

If you're interested in learning about virtualization, you've come to the right place. If you'd also like to learn about Proxmox, you're in the right place.

In this course, we'll learn about virtualization using a high-level open source tool, Proxmox VE version 8.x (PVE), focusing on implementing hyperconverged environments!
The course is designed to develop activities sequentially, where actions performed in one class have an impact on subsequent classes. This is how the course context is set up and presented.

Ps.: Course in Brazilian Portuguese

- [Guide of OPNSense Frewall](https://www.udemy.com/course/guia-opnsense/)

I'd like to welcome you in advance to our Basic Guide to the OPNSENSE Firewall, where we'll explore this tool and develop skills for your professional or personal development.

In this course, we'll learn about the OPNSENSE Firewall and explore some everyday contexts of firewall services in the network. This will help you get the most out of using an open source firewall by applying basic information security rules and aligning it with business needs.

Believe me, starting with the basics will put you ahead of the curve.

Ps.: Course in Brazilian Portuguese
