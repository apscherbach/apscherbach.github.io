## Courses

I have two courses published, where I teach about Virtualization and a little introduction about Firewalls. Both courses was implemented over open source platforms. I show how to use Virtualization in three scenarios(standalone servers, dual servers environments and hyperconvergence) with Proxmox Virtualization Plattform, and how to use OPNSense to build firewalls to protect the network to beginners.

- [ Proxmox VE 8.x](https://www.udemy.com/course/proxmox-ve-8x/)

If you're interested in learning about virtualization, you've come to the right place. If you'd also like to learn about Proxmox, you're in the right place.

In this course, we'll learn about virtualization using a high-level open source tool, Proxmox VE version 8.x (PVE), focusing on implementing hyperconverged environments!
The course is designed to develop activities sequentially, where actions performed in one class have an impact on subsequent classes. This is how the course context is set up and presented.

Ps.: Course in Brazilian Portuguese

- [Guide of OPNSense Frewall](https://www.udemy.com/course/guia-opnsense/)

I'd like to welcome you in advance to our Basic Guide to the OPNSENSE Firewall, where we'll explore this tool and develop skills for your professional or personal development.

In this course, we'll learn about the OPNSENSE Firewall and explore some everyday contexts of firewall services in the network. This will help you get the most out of using an open source firewall by applying basic information security rules and aligning it with business needs.

Believe me, starting with the basics will put you ahead of the curve.

Ps.: Course in Brazilian Portuguese

## Old Projects

Here I present my older past expeiriences. Maybe you find interesting know how I faced some challenges, how the solution was developed and results I achived.
I selected some of chalenges I think merecem be remebered. And, no, I do'nt have register of all that. In some cases, I can't have registers, cause of ethical or contract terms.
Let's begin where I worked from recent to more older:

### CADE - Conselho Administrativo de Defesa Econôminica(Administrative Council for Economic Defense)

The highest body in the area of competition defense in Brazil. I want to work here from a very high sense of make something that really bring social results.
After my previous experience, I certain will contribute more here.

### UFSB - Universidade Federal do Sul da Bahia(Federal University of Southern Bahia)

I started here with the first team approved in a public service exam. When we started (as we speak here), there was only weeds and empty classrooms.
I actively participated in the planning, design and execution of the entire structuring of IT services in the area of networks and infrastructure.
From 2019 to 2022 I was Director of IT Architecture and Security, where I was responsible for a team of 5 people who maintained the entire Network Structure, Firewalls, and services such as Private Cloud, Authentication (Active Directory), Virtualization, Backup, Wireless Networks, Configuration Management and others.

#### SBPC(Brazilian Society for the Advancement of Science) 2016

This was an event organized by the SBPC (Brazilian Society for the Advancement of Science), held in 2016. The event had an estimated attendance of 10,000 people over the course of a week, with approximately 4,000 visitors per day.
I was responsible for the design and implementation of the entire network structure. In this case, it was necessary to modify the existing network structure, which we can call Network V1.
The resources implemented for the event included a redundant network firewall, dedicated active monitoring, and wired and wireless network integration to serve the event's diverse audiences.
The structure was considered one of the most stable in the event's history.
